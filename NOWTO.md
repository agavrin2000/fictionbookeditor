## How to build

To build FBE you need Visual Studio 2015, Community Edition is suitable. You can try previous versions, but it's untested. Nothing else is required.

## How to make installer

To make installer you need to install [NSIS Unicode 2.58 or higher](http://www.scratchpaper.com/). Download [inetc plugin](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in) and copy unicode version to \Plugins folder of NSIS.

Then build Release|Win32 configuration of FBE twice (at first build ExportHTML project cannot find autogenerated by FBE project fbe.h header, will be fixed later). Build Release|x64 version of FBShell project.

Fist run \Installer\MakeInstaller.bat to copy required files to Installer folder, and after this load MakeInstaller.nsi to NSIS and compile.
